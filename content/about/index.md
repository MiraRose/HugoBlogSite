# About Me

![Picture of my face. Short fluffy brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, roundish face, vaguely smiling, wearing white collared, short sleeve shirt with tiny green palm leaves](me.jpg)

Miranda lives in the Midwest with two dogs, her brother, a pleco named Smeagol and a betta fish named nothing at all because you shouldn't name an extra-dimensional planar being lest it turn its void gaze upon you. She'll create a world or solve a puzzle in almost any medium, as long she can do it a little widdershins.
