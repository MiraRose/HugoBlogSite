Just a round up of new content on the ol' website.

## Photography
Added some new photos to the gallery. Got a macro lens, and now I'm even more obsessed with taking photos of things up close.

## Coding
New coding project added! Groobles -- a really simple monster combiner that I'm using to learn Typescript and React.

## Misc.
### Apollo
My brother got a dog, and he's been added to the about me page.
### The Betta Who Shall Not Be Named
The betta lived a good long life (for a betta), but has sadly moved on to that fish tank in the sky.

## Blog?
Will I ever write another blog post? It's a mystery for the ages! Even I don't know the answer.
